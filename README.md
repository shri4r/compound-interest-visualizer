# Compound Interest Calculator

This tool calculates the future value of an investment based on the starting amount, interest rate, and time period. It lets you see the effect of compounding over time. You enter the initial investment amount, the yearly interest rate, and the number of years. The calculator then shows you the total value of the investment at the end of the time period you chose. It also creates a table displaying the detailed numbers for each month - the monthly interest earned and the total balance. This table helps you understand how the investment grows over the years through the power of compounded interest. Finally, you get to see a line chart demonstrating the balance curve over the time.
